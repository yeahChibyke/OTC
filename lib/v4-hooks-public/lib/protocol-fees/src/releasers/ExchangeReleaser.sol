/// protection
/// @dev Note there are some MEV and efficiency considerations around the release length and
/// threshold. If many assets are collected in the token jar, some may never reach a value high
/// enough to be released. Larger release lengths can mitigate this at the cost of higher gas and
/// searching complexity. Sharp price changes relative to the RESOURCE or large deposits into
